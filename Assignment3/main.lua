    Match-3 Remake

    Author: Ali Juma

    Match-3 has taken several forms over the years, with its roots in games
    like Tetris in the 80s. Bejeweled, in 2001, is probably the most recognized
    version of this game, as well as Candy Crush from 2012, though all these
    games owe Shariki, a DOS game from 1994, for their inspiration.

    The goal of the game is to match any three tiles of the same variety by
    swapping any two adjacent tiles; when three or more tiles match in a line,
    those tiles add to the player's score and are removed from play, with new
    tiles coming from the ceiling to replace them.

    The purpose of this assignment is to implement time addition when we get a match,
    make more varieties of blocks spawn as levels progress, create shiny versions
    of blocks that destroy the whole row giving points to each block, only allow swapping
    when it results in a match and finally implementing mouse support.

    As per previous projects, we'll be adopting a retro, NES-quality aesthetic.
